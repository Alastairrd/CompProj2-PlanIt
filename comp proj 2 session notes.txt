csv file, how to represent and read
0 and 1 binary, initial row header can be skipped, for readability
same with first column for times

had to fix click functionality not being a thing on csv test calendar

implementing data-val attribute? do we make active class depend on it? or vice versa


AHHHH
all our grid items for date time are stored in a 'linear' way in one big grid container, including the date time column
this makes it hard to pull meaningful data out of it
need some way to differentiate it
